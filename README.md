Frontend Developer
----------------


I am a Frontend developer with a genuine love for what I do and a passion for creating useful and user-friendly products. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and can develop console and browser-based applications as well as lendings. My experience in sales and running a business has taught me to understand people and work effectively both in a team and independently. I actively utilize TDD and automated testing, know how to work effectively with DOM APIs and manage application state.

Looking for a team where I can continue to learn, share ideas, and help create solutions that improve users' lives. I am ready to quickly learn new technologies and development principles to maximize my ability to join the team and contribute to the common cause.
