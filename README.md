Frontend Developer
----------------
I am a Frontend Developer with a genuine passion for my work and a desire to create useful and user-friendly products. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as React and Redux, with experience in working with libraries to build interactive web applications. I develop both console and browser applications, as well as landing pages, and am skilled in working with REST APIs, WebSockets, and managing state with Redux Toolkit. My experience in sales and business has helped me understand user needs and work effectively both in teams and independently.

I am looking for a team where I can continue to grow, share ideas, and help create solutions that improve users' lives. I am eager to quickly learn new technologies and approaches to integrate effectively into the team and contribute to the common goal.
